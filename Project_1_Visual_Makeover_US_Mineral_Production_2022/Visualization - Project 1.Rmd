**Objective**

As mentioned in the top right corner of the Visual Capitalist (2023) visual, the original objective was to highlight U.S. states that contributed most to America’s mineral production value in 2022. The visual also sheds light on key insights from Southern and Western states and identifies the top producers of gold, silver, copper, and lithium. The goal of this project is to improve the clarity and readability of the original visual, addressing its issues to provide a more effective representation of the data.

**Visual Issues**

* **Difficulty Ranking States:**
  * The bars are not arranged in order, making it hard to quickly identify top and bottom performers by mineral production value.
  * **Solution:** Add a ranked bar chart alongside the map and display mineral production values in the tooltip.

* **Cluttered Eastern States:** 
  * The curved map distorts and clutters the eastern states, making it harder to read, especially as most are ranked 35+. This creates an unintentional bias toward southwestern states.
  * **Solution:** Use a flat map and tooltips to reduce clutter.

* **Poor Color Scheme:**
  * The "Top 5 States Percentage of Total" visual uses a bad color scheme, making it hard to distinguish ranks and read values.
  * **Solution:** Implement a better color gradient and include percentage contribution in the tooltip.

* **Limited Interactivity:** 
  * The original visual lacks interactivity, making it harder to explore deeper insights beyond the static data.
  * **Solution:** Implement an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore additional information dynamically, such as various mineral trends, detailed comparisons, and percentage contributions.
