## Overview  
This project aims to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the original Visual Capitalist (2023) chart, which highlighted U.S. states that contributed most to America's mineral production value in 2022. The goal is to address the visual issues, such as difficulty ranking states, cluttered representation of Eastern states, poor color scheme, and limited interactivity.

## Data Description  
- **Data Source**: USGS (U.S. Geological Survey) (2023). MINERAL COMMODITY SUMMARIES 2023, USGS Publications Repository Website, accessed 27 April 2023. https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023.pdf, pages 10-11, Table 3.â€”Value of Non-fuel Mineral Production in the United States and Principal Non-fuel Mineral Commodities Produced in 2022

## Methodology  
- **Data Visualization**: Using `echarts4r`, the project developed a map-based visual coupled with a ranked bar chart for clear comparison. 
- **Tooltip Integration**: Tooltips were integrated to provide users with mineral production values, percentage contributions, and state rankings interactively.

## Results  
Key insights from the improved visual include:
- Clear identification of the top contributors to U.S. mineral production value.
- Improved legibility of all states, including those in the Eastern U.S.
- Better representation of ranks and mineral production values through interactive tooltips and a ranked bar chart.
  
## How to Use  
- **Setup**: Ensure R is installed with the necessary visualization libraries (`echarts4r`, `shiny`, etc.).
- **Usage**: View the dashboard on RPubs or clone the repository to explore and modify the code locally.
